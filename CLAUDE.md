# Stillwater Approach — Claude Code Instructions

See [README.md](README.md) for game design, seasonal shifts, scoring, carriers, project structure, Lua conventions, and tooling commands.

## Context

I am new to Lua and new to game development. Write clean, well-commented code and explain key decisions as you go.

## Current milestone

**Milestone 5: Landing resolution** — aircraft at the front of the queue lands after a timer, shift progresses. See `README.md` for the full milestone list.

## Pull request instructions

When creating a PR for a completed milestone:
1. Check off the corresponding milestone checkbox in `README.md` (change `- [ ]` to `- [x]`)
2. Include the milestone name in the PR title (e.g. "Milestone 2: one aircraft card")

## Playdate references

- **SDK docs:** Validate API usage against https://sdk.play.date/3.0.3/Inside%20Playdate.html
- **Design guide:** Consider Playdate design best practices at https://help.play.date/developer/designing-for-playdate/

## Usage tracking

Session usage is logged to `.claude/usage-log.jsonl.local` (gitignored) via a Stop hook. The pre-commit hook (`_scripts/pre-commit.sh`) merges it into the tracked `.claude/usage-log.jsonl` before each commit automatically.

`make install` installs the hook. No other manual steps needed — just commit normally.

## Dev setup

```
make install  # install dependencies and git hooks
make help     # see all available targets
```

Run the simulator with `make sim`. Requires the Playdate SDK installed locally.

## Release workflow

Only release when changes affect the installed game (features, fixes, UI, mechanics). Do not release for tooling, docs, or build-system-only changes.

To release a new version:

```
make release VERSION=x.y.z
```

This updates `source/pdxinfo`, commits with message `Release vX.Y.Z`, and tags the commit. Review the changes, then push with the command it echoes. The GitHub release workflow is triggered automatically on tag push.

## Technical notes

- Target: **Playdate hardware** (also test in simulator)
- SDK: Playdate SDK (Lua API) — install from play.date/dev/ for local builds
- Use `playdate.graphics` aliased as `gfx` for drawing
- Use `playdate.update()` as the main game loop (60fps)
- Use `playdate.datastore` for persistent logbook storage
- No external libraries — standard SDK only
- Tables as objects pattern: `function Aircraft.new(...)`
- Time-based fuel tick using `playdate.getCurrentTimeMilliseconds()` or a frame counter
