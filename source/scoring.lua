-- Scoring module: calculates end-of-shift score from landed aircraft.
-- Pure Lua, no SDK dependency — fully unit-testable.

-- luacheck: globals Scoring
Scoring = {}

-- Calculates the score for a completed shift from a list of landed aircraft.
-- Returns { landed_count, avg_fuel_pct, near_miss_count, total }.
--
-- An empty landed list (no aircraft landed) returns total = 0; the base score
-- requires at least one aircraft to have landed.
--
-- Scoring formula (when landed is non-empty):
--   base       = 50  (for landing at least one aircraft)
--   efficiency = floor(50 * avg_fuel_pct)  (0..50, based on average fuel remaining)
--   penalty    = 10 * near_miss_count      (deducted per near-miss landing)
--   total      = max(0, base + efficiency - penalty)
--
-- A "near miss" is any aircraft that landed with fuel < CRITICAL_FUEL_PCT of its starting fuel.
